{5, "It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this."}.
{6, "But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. "}.
{7, "The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract."}.
{8, "The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. "}.
{9, "It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. "}.
{10, "It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."}.
{11, "The module make provides a set of functions similar to the UNIX type Make functions."}.
